TurlockCityBooze
================

This is a website I built in the last semester at CSU Stanislaus in Turlock to find the happy hours currently happening in town. After graduating and moving out of the area it didn't seem right to run a website for a community I am no longer part of. 

In it's short life (about 6 months) the website was able to recover the cost of running it. I have since started taking what I built for internal use and started building it as a consumer CMS. This is just the code I used to run it. It was built in just a few short weeks between classes.
